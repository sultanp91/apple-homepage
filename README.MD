The project is taken from The Odin Project - the goal is to practice CSS gradients by recreating this [Apple homepage from 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/). It is not required to recreate any of the dynamic functionality - only to recreate the look of the page. The page is also not required to be mobile responsive and is best viewed on a desktop/laptop screen.
